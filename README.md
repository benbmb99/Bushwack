# Overview

This application is meant to help you keep track of items whether you are shopping or you are preparing for an outdoor expedition. It currently has a home screen and a list creation screen. The home screen provides details of what the app will be in the future. The list screen allows the user to create lists and keep track of items they may need.

My reason behind creating this app is to help avid outdoorists, like myself, to keep track of everything you need, and in the future to create a safety net for people in case they might get lost while bushwhacking through the brush. 

(Note: I haven't quite gotten this app to the full functionality yet, but I hope to in the future as I continue to learn how to do this.)

# Development Environment

For this application, I used Android Studio created by Google to create the app. I also used a textbook (that was rather out of date, especially as I had to update the software mid-creation) that was semi helpful at least in understanding how things worked.

The programming language that I chose to use in the end was Kotlin. I don't believe I used any libraries to create this app.

# Future Work

* My main priority is to get the 'Add' button working! I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to get it to actually add the element of text to the list.
* I would really like to be able to make multiple lists based on what the user wants. If you want to make a shopping list and a dinner list and a hiking list and a food storage list and ... whatever else you want..., you should!
* I want to be able to use the maps to track location precisely so if you get off the trail or lost, you should be able to follow your path exactly back to the trail.
